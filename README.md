[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevezhu/meteor-fbgraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevezhu/meteor-fbgraph)

A meteor wrapper package for [fbgraph](http://criso.github.io/fbgraph/)

Currently using fbgraph v0.3.0

## Usage

Consult [fbgraph](http://criso.github.io/fbgraph/) for documentation.  
The only difference is that the `graph` referenced in the readme is instead `FBGraph` in this package.

Example
```
FBGraph.setAccessToken(access_token);
```
